# Erickson Living Web Developer Assignment

Inside the attached zip file, you'll find screenshots of a landing page we built using Bootstrap. Your assignment is to build a working version of this page using Bootstrap and host it somewhere that we can review it. There are three screenshots to illustrate the behavior at the different breakpoints: large, medium, and small (there's no separate styling for extra-small screens).

You'll find files for the logo, the picture of the woman, and the Equal Housing Opportunity logo included as well. You should use an icon font, like Font Awesome, for the phone, YouTube, and Facebook icons.

Since the main font is not a free web font, you should feel free to use a similar web font of your choice. Do not use Arial or Helvetica.

Extra credit: Use the client-side validation of your choice to make the First Name, Last Name, Home Phone, and Email Address fields required on the form. You do not need to make the form actually work and submit anywhere. You should leave the form action blank. Additionally, for more extra credit, validate the phone and email fields as a valid phone number and email address, respectively.

Use whatever resources you need to complete the assignment (Google, Stack Overflow, etc.), and feel free to ask questions, just as you would if you were working here. We want to see not only what your level of ability is, but what your working process is like.

*Good luck!*
