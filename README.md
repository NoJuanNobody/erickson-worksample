<h1># erickson-worksample</h1>
<p>a landing page that includes a responsive UI, and authentication on some user fields. </p>
<p>I used several technologies to get create the final worksample</p>

<h2>Bootstrap</h2>
<p>I was successful in using mainly the grid aspect of bootstrap I rarely had to used custom widths here and there but it worked out great!</p>
<h2>Font Awesome</h2>
  <p>I was happy with my use of font awesome, I included it in the project via CDN (its a little faster to host files like this through a CDN anyways.) I styled the youtube and facebook images with css. Is there a way to use font awesome in a pseudo selector? I was unsucessful for some reason. I will have to do more research</p>
<h2>Sass</h2>
  <p>I was happy to use Sass on this project because it kept my project more maintainable. I have included the Sass file in the project for you to consider. I found nesting and variables to be extremely useful, and I hope to better understand the Extend rule in the future, because I have a feeling that if I did this I might have had a shorter Sass file. For the mean time, I still think that it was usefull because I can change the colors very quickly based on how everything is configured. </p>
<h2>Compass</h2>
  <p>I used compass to set up my css project and to watch the project for any changes on the Sass stylesheets. Normally I would include a partials file and a reset, but it seemed unecessary considering this was only a one page worksample. I think there is a way to get compass to auto reload your page as well but i have not fully looked into it yet. </p>
<h2>Media queries</h2>
 <p> some of the styles that you requested at certain widths were not inherent in bootstrap, so i had to use media queries to make sure everything looked as it should. This was a simple task. </p>
<h2>Jquery</h2>
 <p> The extent of jQuery that I used was to grab dom elements from the document. I find that document.getElementByClass name is tedious. I think i also used a small handful of other jquery functions but it was honestly minimal</p>
<h2>Javascript</h2>
 <p> Authentication was done with javascript. I created two functions, one to test if each required field was empty or not, and another to throw an error if there something was not filled out. </p>
<h2>bower Package manager</h2>
<p>I used bower to install bootstrap and jquery. Its really convenient!</p>
<h3>In conclusion</h3>
<p>I hope I was able to meet your standards as a jr web developer. and I appreciate the time you have taken to consider me.</p>
